        <h1>Sobre nós</h1>
        <p>Thirteen years ago, Joe, Nate, and I created a company that was viewed at the time as an unlikely idea to work. Airbnb has always been a little different, and as we take our company public, we feel compelled to tell you a little more about what makes Airbnb, Airbnb.
        
        We started writing this letter in March. Then the pandemic hit. When borders closed and travel stopped, our business declined by nearly 80%. We had to put our IPO on hold, and I don’t think many people expected us to go public this year. I know some people questioned if we’d make it at all. What has transpired since then has been our most defining period since we started Airbnb.
        
        They say that a crisis has a way of revealing your true character. We would like to tell you about what this crisis revealed about who we are.
        
        First, our model is inherently adaptable. Over the summer, after months of being stuck inside their homes, people were yearning to connect with their loved ones in a safe way. They decided to get in their cars and travel close to home, often staying in small towns and rural communities. Because we have millions of hosts who offer nearly all types of homes and experiences around the world, we were able to adapt to the new use cases guests wanted — from working remotely from another home, to taking extended trips with family and friends. Our business rebounded faster than anyone expected, and it showed that as the world changes, our model is able to adapt.
        
        This crisis reinforced three truths that are even more core to who we are, and how we intend to operate for generations to come. As our prospective investors, we want to tell you about each.
